While using this version of Drupal 8.5.3 for testing using an Blue/Green deployment.

 This repository is being used to demonstrate if its possible to use a Blue/Green deployment.

## Deployment Tools 

**Github** - Used as a repository to hold the code base and using tags to deployment

**GitLab** - Testing to see if scheduling works?

**AWS** - EC2, Database, Codepipeline?

**CircleCI** - See if its possible? 

## Demostrate/Questions

- No interuption for content users or public user during deploying?

- To see if works with current setup?

- Need to demonstrate that it does work with Drupal config and database update?

- To see what the cost would be for tools?
